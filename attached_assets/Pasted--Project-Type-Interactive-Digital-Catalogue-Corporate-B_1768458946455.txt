📌 Project Type

Interactive Digital Catalogue / Corporate Brochure (NOT a website)
Mobile-first, touch-friendly, premium design

🎯 Objective

Create a unique, attractive, modern digital catalogue for VIP Networks, using content from the uploaded FIN VIP BROCHURE PDF, and following the UI/UX flow style shown in the reference images (home → explore → categories → hamburger menu).

This should feel like a digital brochure or catalogue, not a traditional website.

🧭 Overall Flow (Very Important)

Home / Cover Screen

Explore Services (Catalogue Inside Pages)

Category-wise Services View

Hamburger Menu (Mobile Slide-in Catalogue Menu)

🟢 1️⃣ HOME / COVER SCREEN (Like Image 1 – Reference Only)

Full-screen hero cover

Company logo (as shown in PDF)

Tagline: “Where Technology Meets Reliability”

Short intro text (from brochure)

One main CTA button:
“Explore Services”

Smooth fade / slide animation

Dark + premium IT-tech background

Looks like the front page of a brochure

👉 Clicking Explore Services scrolls or transitions into catalogue pages (no page reload).

🟢 2️⃣ SERVICES OVERVIEW (Like Image 2 – Reference Only)

Display services as catalogue cards, not website sections.

Each card shows:

Service icon / illustration (tech-related)

Service name

Short description line

Use these categories (from PDF):

CCTV Surveillance & Networking

Thermal & Fire Detection Systems

Intercom & IPBX Communication

Biometrics & Smart Access Locks

Public Addressable (PA)

Audio Visual & Room Automation

Projector & Display Solutions

Printers / Desktop / Laptop

UPS & Battery Solutions

IoT / Cloud / Software Solutions

Network Booster

Cards should feel like catalogue tiles, not clickable buttons.

🟢 3️⃣ SERVICE DETAIL VIEW (Inside Catalogue)

When a service is tapped:

Open a clean inner catalogue section

Show:

Service title

Description text from the PDF

Bullet points exactly as per brochure

Related illustrative images (tech visuals if original missing)

Smooth transitions

Plenty of white/spacing like a brochure page

No forms, no pricing, no enquiry buttons

🟢 4️⃣ HAMBURGER MENU (Like Image 3 – Reference Only)

Hamburger icon visible in mobile view

On click → slide-in catalogue menu

Menu shows:

All service categories (icons + text)

Contact info at bottom

Social icons (optional)

This menu should feel like a catalogue index, not website navigation
